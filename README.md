# README

My notebooks from various activities. Some are from hackathons.
It was not my goal to make everything perfect,  but many use interesting
technologies and libraries.

I have many pet-projects in notebooks and will add it here sometimes.

- `OpenDataBattle(pytorch_tabnet)` - from hack Open Data Battle, my first experience of TabNet
- `NEUROHACK (wav2vec)` - from hack NEUROHACK, 5th place. Distil wav2vec less than 300 mb model size
